# Creative Scala v2
## Goals
  * Accessible to people who have not programmed a computer before
  * Develop a basic machine model that can be used to predict program behavior
  * Be able to read, but perhaps not write, moderately complex Scala code
  * Provide a foundation in fundamental concepts that will transfer to Essential Scala and beyond
- Demonstate that programming in general, and Scala in particular, can be fun
## Outline
### Introduction
  Layout goals and structure of the book
### Getting Started
  * Install required software
  * Text editor + SBT OR IntelliJ
  * Doodle
  * Run a basic program
### Expressions and Values
  * Expressions evaluate to values
  * Expressions have types <EXPAND. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?>
  * Values are objects <DITTO>
  * Syntax
    * Operator vs method style
  * This is our most basic model
  * Simple expressions---boring
  * Expressions involving graphics
  * Examples
    * Nested circles
    * Other...
### Bindings
  * Naming values
  * The substitution model of evaluation
### First-order Methods
  * Abstract over expressions

### Recursion
  * Structural recursion over the natural numbers
### Higher-order Methods
  * Animations
