# Foreword {-}

Creative Scala is aimed at developers who are brand new to Scala.
We assume you have some familiarity with another programming language
but little or no experience with Scala or functional programming.

Our goal is to provide a taster of functional programming in Scala,
demonstrating the building blocks that developers use to create programs.
Working through the material and exercises should take two to three hours,
after which we hope you will have a feel of what Scala can do
for your applications.

Although Creative Scala will give you the basic
functional programming mind-set required to become competent with Scala,
you won't finish the book with *everything* you need to be self-sufficient.
For example, we don't cover the object-oriented parts of Scala
such as defining classes and traits.
For further advancement we recommend you consider one of the many excellent
Scala textbooks out there, including our own [Essential Scala][essential-scala].

The majority of Creative Scala uses
a toy graphics library called [Doodle][doodle].
We developed Doodle to make learning Scala fun,
but we based it on classical functional programming concepts
that can be applied in many business applications.
The source code for this book and Doodle are open source
and available from [Underscore's Github account][underscore-github].

If you are working through the exercises on your own,
we highly recommend joining our [Gitter chat room]
to provide us with feedback and get help with the exercises.

That's all. Thanks for downloading and happy creative programming!

---Dave and Noel
