# Foreword {-}

Creative Scala is aimed at developers who have no prior experience in Scala.
It is designed to give you a vital first taste of functional programming.
We assume you have some familiarity with another programming language
but little or no experience with Scala or other functional languages.

Our goal is to demonstrate the building blocks that Scala developers use
to create programs in a clear, succinct, declarative manner.
Working through the exercises in the book should take two to three hours,
after which we hope you will have a feel of what Scala can do
for your applications.

Although this book will give you the basic mental model
required to become competent with Scala,
you won't finish knowing *everything* you need to be self-sufficient.
For further advancement we recommend considering one of the many excellent
Scala textbooks out there, including our own [Essential Scala][essential-scala].

If you are working through the exercises on your own,
we highly recommend joining our [Gitter chat room][underscore-gitter]
to provide get help with the exercises and provide feedback on the book.

The text of [Creative Scala][github-creative-scala] is open souce,
as is the source code for the [Doodle][github-doodle]
drawing library used in the exercises.
You can grab the code from our [Github account][underscore-github].
Contact us on Gitter or by email if you would like to contribute.

Thanks for downloading and happy creative programming!
