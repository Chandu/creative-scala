## Github

We have created a [template] for you that will get you setup with all the code you need to work through Creative Scala.
This template is stored on [Github][github], a website for sharing code.

If you do not have a Github account, create one now.

Once you have an account, visit the [template] (https://github.com/underscoreio/creative-scala-template) in your browser. 
At the top right is button called "Fork". 
Press this button to create your own copy of the template.
You will be taken to a web page displaying your own fork of the template.
Remember the name of this repository (it should be something like `yourname/creative-scala-template` where `yourname` is your Github user name) as you will need it later.
