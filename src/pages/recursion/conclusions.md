## Conclusions

In this chapter we've seen our first big pattern for structuring code, *structural recursion over the natural numbers*.
We've seen a lot of examples that generate images, but we can use this pattern for anything that is transforming a natural number into anything else (including other natural numbers).

We'll use this pattern, and other variants of structural recursion, throughout the book.
