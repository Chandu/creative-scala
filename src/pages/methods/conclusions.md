## Conclusions

In this chapter we've learned how to write our own simple methods, and seen how we can use the substitution model of evaluation to understand method calls.

We've seen that methods both abstract over expressions, in the same way as names, and also generalise over expressions, allowing us to represent a group of related expressions with one name.

We've written some interesting methods, but we've still have more repeated code than in desirable (think about the repeated calls to `box` and `circle` in the exercises.)
In the next chapter we learn how we can generalise over this using structural recursion over the natural numbers.
