# Declarations

Not all programs are single expressions.
Sometimes it is useful to bind expressions to a name and re-use them later.
These constructs are called *declarations*.
Declarations themselves don't have a type or a value.
However, they do bind names that can be used as expressions.
There are several types of declaration in Scala as we shall see below.
