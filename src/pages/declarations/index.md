# Declarations

Not all programs are single expressions.
Sometimes it is useful to bind expressions to a name and re-use them later.
These constructs are called *declarations*.
Declarations themselves don't have a type or a value.
However, they do bind names that can be used as expressions.
There are several types of declaration in Scala as we shall see below.

## Recursive algorithms

Let's put our new-found skills with colour to use on some recursive algorithms.
Recursion is a natural part of functional programming.
The classic functional data structure---the linked list---is recursive in nature.
Before we start looking at lists, however, let's create some recursive pictures.

**TODO: Concentric circles**
- Draw it (structural recursion over natural numbers)
- Supply fixed colour-changing operation to palette cycle

**TODO: Sierpinski triangle**

## Functions as values

**TODO: Higher order functions**

**TODO: Stripey wormholes**
- Use palette functions to abstract colour changes

**TODO: Rainbow sierpinski**
- "Sierpinkski"
