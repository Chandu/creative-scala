## Literal Expressions

We'll now start to explore the various forms of expressions in Scala, starting with the simplest expressions *literals*. Here's a literal expression:

```tut:book
3
```

A literal evaluates to "itself." How we write the expression and how the console prints the value are the same. Remember though, there is a difference between the written representation of a value and its actual representation in the computer's memory.

Scala has many different forms of literals. We've already seen `Int` literals.
