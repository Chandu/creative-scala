# Structural Recursion

In this chapter we see our first major pattern for structuring computations: *structural recursion over the natural numbers*. That's quite a mouthful, so let's break it down:

- By a pattern, we mean a way of writing code that is useful in lots of different contexts. We'll encounter structural recursion in many different situations throughout this book. 

- By the natural numbers we simply mean the whole numbers 0, 1, 2, and upwards. 

- By recursion we mean something that refers to itself. Structural recursion means a recursion that follows the structure of the data it is processing. We'll see in more detail what this means in a moment.
