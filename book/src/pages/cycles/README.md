# Composition and Cycles

This is our final chapter focused on creative computing. We'll return to creative computing in other parts of the book but other topics will be our focus.

We're going to finish with a bang, working on a bigger project than we've tackled so far. In this chapter we will learn about function composition, spline interpolation, and epicycles. We'll bring everything together to create complex pictures similar to those made using a [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph).
