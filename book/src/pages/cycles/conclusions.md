# Conclusions

This chapter has focused on function composition.
We've used `Angle => Point` functions to represent parametric curves,
and we have seen that we can build many useful abstractions around them by using function composition.

Functions are not the only things that compose. 
Every time we've used the `beside`, or `above` methods on `Image`, for example, we've been composing images.
This notion of composition is one of the key ideas in functional programming, and we'll continue to see it throughout the book.
