# (Functional) Programming

So far we have seen how to write literals, expressions,
value declarations, and method declarations.
We now have the tools to write non-trivial programs that generate complex images.
In this chapter we will introduce some more tools
to our functional programming toolbox and create even more complex images:
recursion, first-class functions, and higher-order functions.
