# Part One: Conclusions

We've reached the end of Part One, which has focused on creative computing.


Review.


Before we set this topic aside, I want to mention some people and places that I found inspiring in creating this content.
This is not intended to be in any way an authorative collection, but I hope it might provide you with some inspiration if you want to go further in creative computing.

[Saskia Freeke](https://sasj.nl/) for many years has been posting an artwork daily to her social media. 
A lot of her work use simple geometric shapes arranged on a grid, 
which are very amenable to reproducing in Doodle using the techniques we've learned so far.

Going beyond grid patterns quickly leads to the complex geometry of [Islamic tile work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns).
[Craig Kaplan](https://isohedral.ca/) has worked on [algorithms to create Islamic star patterns](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/publications/Papers/kaplan_2000.pdf) (as well as many other creative ideas in computer graphics.) His papers are quite heavy on the mathematics but you can still get a lot out of just the pictures illustrating the construction.

If symmetrical tiling is your thing, [Creating Symmetry](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691161730/creating-symmetry) is the best book I know of for exploring this. I think you will need at least some University level mathematics to make headway in this book.

[George Savva](https://linktr.ee/georgemsavva) creates artworks that make creative use of parametric curves. He also posts detailed breakdowns of the process behind his images [such as this post which uses Lissajous curves](https://georgemsavva.github.io/creativecoding/posts/lissajous/).

[Jared Tarbell](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/) is a legend in the field of creative computing, and also a co-founder of [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). A lot of his work is over two decades old, but it still feels fresh. His website has just enough detail on his process that it's possible to reconstruct some of his work.

You can't go far in creative computing without running into [Processing](https://processing.org/) and its descendant [p5js](https://p5js.org/). 
They are probably the two most widely used software packages in the creative computing world, but are based on quite a different programming model to Doodle. You can't go very far in the Processing world without running into [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) and his website [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), which has many many tutorials on a huge range of topics.

Images are not the only medium for creative computing. [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) is a programming language for creating music, and [Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a language for creating non-linear fiction. "Physical computing", which essentially means robotics, is another outlet.

Finally, I want to mention
