# Part One: Conclusions

We've reached the end of Part One, which focused on creative computing.
Let's take a bit of time to look back at what we've learned.

Our first topic was reasoning about code, culminating in the substitution model of evaluation. Along the way we learned the fundamental building blocks of expressions, types, and value.

We next looked at structural recursion over the natural numbers, which we used to create fractals, polygons, and more. We saw that the structure in structural recursion gives special reasoning techniques for dealing with recursion.

Finally we looked at functions and function composition. We saw that functions give us a form of abstraction. We saw a number of uses of this abstraction, including `fold` and parametric curves. We saw that composition allows us to create lots of reusable tools, which we put work producing parametric curves.

Before we set this topic aside, I want to mention some people and places that I found inspiring in creating this content.
This is not intended to be in any way an authorative collection, but I hope it might provide you with some inspiration if you want to go further in creative computing.

[Saskia Freeke](https://sasj.nl/) for many years has posted a daily artwork to her social media. 
A lot of her work uses simple geometric shapes arranged on a grid, 
which is very amenable to reproduction in Doodle using the techniques we've learned.

Going beyond grid patterns quickly leads to the complex geometry of [Islamic tile work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns).
[Craig Kaplan](https://isohedral.ca/) has worked on [algorithms to create Islamic star patterns](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/publications/Papers/kaplan_2000.pdf) (as well as many other creative ideas in computer graphics.) His papers are quite heavy on the mathematics but you can still get a lot out of just the pictures illustrating the construction.

If symmetrical tiling is your thing, [Creating Symmetry](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691161730/creating-symmetry) is the best book I know for exploring the mathematics behind it. I think you will need at least some University level mathematics to make headway in this book.

[George Savva](https://linktr.ee/georgemsavva) creates artworks that make creative use of parametric curves. He also posts detailed breakdowns of the process behind his images [such as this post which uses Lissajous curves](https://georgemsavva.github.io/creativecoding/posts/lissajous/).

[Jared Tarbell](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/) is a legend in the field of creative computing, and also a co-founder of [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/). A lot of his work is over two decades old, but it still feels fresh. His website has just enough detail on his process that it's possible to reconstruct some of his work.

You can't go far in creative computing without running into [Processing](https://processing.org/) and its descendant [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). 
They are probably the two most widely used software packages in the creative computing world, but are based on quite a different programming model to Doodle. You can't go very far in the Processing world without running into [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) and his website [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), which has many many tutorials on a huge range of topics.

Images are not the only medium for creative computing. [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) is a programming language for creating music, and [Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a system for creating non-linear fiction. [Physical computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing) is another outlet.

[Ravi Chugh](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rchugh/) looks at the intersection of human-computer interaction and programming languages. I find his work really inspiring for imagining a different yet attainable way of working with computers. Going further afield, [Chris Martens](https://www.convivial.tools/) looks at the intersection of programming languages and games. 

If you have decided you can't live without more creative computing in your life, and the above don't slake your thirst, [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/) is probably the premier source for online courses. For even more creative computing, many universities now offer degree programs in the field. Notable examples are the [Creative Computing Institute](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute) in London, and the [Tisch School of Art](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) in New York City.
