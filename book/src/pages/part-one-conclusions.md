# Part One: Conclusions

We've reached the end of Part One, which focused on creative computing.
Before we set this topic aside, let's mention some places to find more if you want to go further on your own.
This is not intended to be in any way an authorative collection.
It's just people, books, and sites that I've found inspiring.

## Artists

We'll start with a few artists.

* [Saskia Freeke](https://sasj.nl/) is an artist and designer based in Amsterdam. She posts a new artwork every day on her social media. A lot of her works use simple geometric shapes arranged on a grid, which are very amenable to reproducing in Doodle using the techniques we've learned so far.
* [George Savva](https://georgemsavva.github.io/creativecoding/) is a statistican living in the UK who creates algorithmic art as a hobby. He posts some detailed breakdowns of the process behind his images [such as this post using Lissajous curves](https://georgemsavva.github.io/creativecoding/posts/lissajous/).
