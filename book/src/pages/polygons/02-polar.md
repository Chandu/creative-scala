# Polar Coordinates

A point in two dimensions is most commonly specified using x and y coordinates. These are known as *Cartesian coordinates* after their inventor, Ren√© Descartes. We can visualize a Cartesian coordinate as projecting a vertical line from the x-axis and a horizontal line from the y-axis. The intersection of these two lines is the chosen point. The animation below shows this.

An alternate representation is *polar coordinates*. In polar coordinates, a point is specified by a length and a rotation. The animation below illustrates this.
