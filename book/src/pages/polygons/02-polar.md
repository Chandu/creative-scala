# Polar Coordinates

You are probably used to specifying a point in two dimensions using x and y coordinates. These are known as *Cartesian coordinates* after their inventor, Ren√© Descartes.

In cartesian coordinates, we determine a point using an x and a y coordinate. We can think of this as moving to a spot on the x-axis, and tracing up or down till we reach the spot on the y-axis. The animation below shows this.

In polar coordinates, a point is determined by a length followed by a rotation. The animation below illustrates this.
