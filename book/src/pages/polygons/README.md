# Points, Paths, and Polygons

In this chapter we'll learn about polar coordinates and paths. We'll use these tools to expand our creative coding skills, producing pictures themed around polygons and stars. We'll also get more practice with structural recursion, reinforcing this core technique.

Don't forget, you will need to start your code with the following imports for the examples to work.

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.effect.unsafe.implicits.global
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.syntax.all._
import doodle.image.syntax.all._
import doodle.java2d._
```
