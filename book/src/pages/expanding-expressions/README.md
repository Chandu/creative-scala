# Expanding Expressions

So far we have seen expressions using the `Int` type. We will need quite a few more types, and a lot more expressions, to create the kind of expressive programs we're aiming for. 

In this chapter we will:

* learn about literal expressions and use them to create more of Scala's basic types;
* learn about objects and methods which we'll use to create compound expressions;
* see the operator style of method calls; and
* learn more about how types relate to compound expressions.

For this chapter you can continue to use the worksheet we've already created.
