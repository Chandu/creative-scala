# Conclusions

In this chapter we've learned how to create fractals, deepening our understanding of structural recursion.
We've also seen how we can extend the basic structural recursion strategy with nested methods and auxillary parameters. 
This extends the expressiveness of structural recursion over the natural numbers, and gives us new creative possibilities in our coding.
